**Roles for Ashiva** are entirely customisable.

**Roles** initialise with the a series of basic settings which can all be changed or updated.

Fundamentally, on any given site, **Roles** settings determine which **Da3SH Modules** may be accessed and by whom.

## Available Roles

 - Page Editor
 - Site Editor
 - Site Developer
 - Site Producer
 - Site Director

At present there is also a *catch-all* role to cover any arbitrary administrative role:

 - Admin
